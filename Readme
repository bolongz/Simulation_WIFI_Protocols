This is the project 3s for the Data comm class. We have two programs for this project: traffic_geneorator and simulator.

2. For traffic_generator program, it will generator the test cases:

   Run syntax is as following:

       For the "method" parameter:  you can choice are exp and uniform
       [seed] is optional

3. For simulator, we implemented 2 simulators: dcf protocol and rts protocol.
